# Hobby Page - Roundel Round We Go podcast
## A webpage for a podcast about the London Underground

This webpages was created for two reasons: one was to meet the requirements for entry into the Founders & Coders programme, and one was to test some basic design concepts for a website for the podcast 'Roundel Round We Go' â€“ a passion project of my partner and I which we've been running since early 2021 but have not had a website for beyond those auto-generated by podcast hosting platforms.

### Features:

- an unordered list rearranged into a mock menu in the header (currently has no functionality)
- images with alt text
- a link to listen to the podcast on Anchor 
- three boxes that feature the latest episodes with the ability to hover over them to use an embedded audio player to listen (these currently would need to be updated manually when new episodes are released, though we are currently between episodes)
- a live-updated date in the footer created with DOM manipulation

### Process:

Much of this website was changed and improved as I became more competent in coding. This led to several frustrations, particularly around moving from what was an unresponsive website to a responsive one, and putting in flexboxes around the existing content. I am sure this website contains code that doesn't actaully have any purpose, and I know there are ways I built things at the beginning that were more complicated than they needed to be (for example, setting padding or margins for each side of an object individually). There are a few things I tried on the site which I later removed because I couldn't get them to work, these include:

- longer description of the latest episode in the hover sections (I wasn't able to get these to shrink when the boxes resized
- a fixed header (I was able to get this to work, but it required a lot of media queries to constantly change the padding for the text below it and I found the inconsistency of sizing unattractive)

While I am very happy with this project for the purposes of my Founders & Coders application, there is considerably more I'd like to do with the project and eventually make it into a live, fully functional website. Any advice or collaboration on that would be warmly welcomed.
