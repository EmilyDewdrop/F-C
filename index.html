          <p class="description">
            When Emily met Paul (in an underground station, of all places) she
            decided his ever-growing collection of books about the underground
            needed a use. So together, in the depths of a January lockdown, they
            came up with a concept for a podcast. Each episode, they'd pull the
            name of a station from a bag, research it, and create a show.
            Twenty-four shows in, with hunderdeds on listeners, they're not
            stopping any time soon!

              A station on the Central Line in west London, Northolt had rural
              beginnings until the Great Western Railway and a pony racing track
              brought visitors, and eventually residents, to the area. With the
              underground taking over the line in 1948, and Ealing Council
              filling the area with social housing, it's now a busy suburb and
              the site of tunneling for HS2.

              Built by the Great Northern Railway in suburban North London,
              Woodside Park Station was opened in 1872 before being taken over
              by the Underground in 1940. We explore the area around the station
              and also joined by transport photographer extraordinaire Luke
              Agbaimoni AKA TubeMapper to talk the perfect shots and his love of
              puddles!

              Originally opening on the Central London Railway in 1900 and
              Hampstead Tube in 1907, the station has been constantly
              redeveloped over the years to cope with far too many people,
              bringing us up to date with the coming of the Elizabeth Line! We
              talk pop art, brutalism, and lots of trains in this bumper
              episode!
